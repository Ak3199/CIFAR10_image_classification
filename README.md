# CIFAR10_image_classification

I have implemented 3 models: 
1. LeNet
2. VGG19
3. DenseNet
4. Residual Network

to perform image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset and compare the performance of each model

Model Name | #Params | Batch_Size | Accuracy |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
LeNet | 62k | 128 | 76.23|
VGG19 | 39M | 128 | 93.53|
Residual Network | 1.7M | 128 | 93.93|
DenseNet | 7.5M | 64 | 95.90|
